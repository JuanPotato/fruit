I will be judging the fruits as fruits eaten raw except when I don't. Fruits will not be judged on consistent criteria. The scores are both final and subject to change. These are my opinions and they are fact. Let the games begin.

### [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple)
Crunchy, sweet, tart. Plenty of varieties. I ate an entire apple with seeds in highschool english class and a girl called me a horse.

7.5/10

### [Apricot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apricot)
What a beautiful fruit. Soft, sweet. One easily removed seed. If only it was more widely available. I was raised on apricot jam and bread.

9/10

### [Avocado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avocado)
Delicious. Not a fruit. 

0/10

### [Banana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana)
Staple fruit. Has some unfortunate ties to oppression. Soft, too soft. Love banana bread. I drank too many smoothies when my wisdom teeth were removed.

6.8/10

### [Blackberry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackberry)
Yay a foraging fruit. Truly best when its crumbling and you can't wash it lest the water tear it apart. Go to a farm and pick peaches too.

8.5/10

### [Blackcurrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackcurrant)
I've tried these dried and they were alright.

6.5/10

### [Blueberry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueberry)
Honestly overrated fruit. Great frozen. Needs to be less popular.

7/10

### [Cactus pear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cactus_pear)
Pokey fruit. Filled with seeds. Still manages to have enough pulp to taste good and better than most fruits. Also sold by turkish street vendors.

7.7/10

### [Canistel (Egg Fruit)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canistel)
Also called a vietnamese avocado. Hardly a fruit. Soft boiled egg yolk like texture. Sweet like a squash. Was difficult to eat the whole thing.

4/10

### [Cherimoya (Custard Apple)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherimoya)
I don't know if this is what I ate.

6.5/10

### [Cherry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry)
I love to make cherry jam with my mom at home. Apparently you shouldn't eat the whole bag? I thought the seeds would kill you because they had cyanide.

8.7/10

### [Coconut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut)
This is not a fruit. Excellent topping.

0/10

### [Crab apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_apple)
Small apple? Not bad. Just eat an apple tbh.

7/10

### [Cranberry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranberry)
Mostly air. Pops. Great juice. My family eats it with salt.

7.7/10

### [Date (fresh)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_palm)
Dates are crunchy, sweet, and sometimes bitter but not that type of bitter. Give me a jug of saudi coffee and a couple pounds of dates and I will be set.

10/10

### [Date (dried)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_palm)
So good it needs two entries. Oh so many many varieties.

10/10

### [Dragonfruit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfruit)
Apparently the yellow ones taste better. The purple ones don't taste like much at all.

6/10

### [Durian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durian)
Honestly better than expected. Still tasted like onions though. Do NOT bring on the train.

6/10

### [Fig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fig)
My dearest friend. Sweet like honey. Many varieties. All wonderful (honestly except mission figs from california). I have gotten food poisoning from them before but its not the fruit's fault.

10/10

### [Goji berry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goji_berry)
The turkish delight I was eating was covered in dried goji berries. Very good.

8/10

### [Gooseberry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gooseberry)
Awful berry tastes like a tomato.

3/10

### [Grape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape)
My love for grapes is unending. Specifically green ones. A kings fruit. I have eaten three pounds in one sitting but I blame ADHD.

10/10

### [Grapefruit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapefruit)
Why the white part bitter and the inside not that much better???

5/10 with pith
7/10 without pith

Hawthorn candy. Tanghulu.

9/10

### [Jujube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jujube)

10/10
